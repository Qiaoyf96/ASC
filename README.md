# ASC

This is the code and data repository for the paper **Threshold-driven pruning with segmented maximum term weights for approximate cluster-based sparse retrieval** by Yifan Qiao, Parker Carlson, Shanxiu He, Yingrui Yang, and Tao Yang. 

The code is forked from and build upon [PISA](https://github.com/pisa-engine/pisa).

## Instructions

To build the project,

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j reorder-docids lexicon compress_inverted_index create_wand_data evaluate_queries
```

To execute the code,

```
./evaluate_queries -e block_simdbp -i $COMPRESSED_INDEX_FILE -w $WAND_FILE -q $QUERY_FILE -k 1000 -a maxscore_boun
dsum --weighted -s quantized --documents $DOC_LEX_FILE --max-clusters $CLUSTER_SIZE --threads 0 --mu $MU_VAL â€”eta $ETA_VAL --subcluster_size_path $SUB_CLUSTER_SIZE_FILE
```

The required files can either be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1La2PL27fjYbjp8dtd0lV_G9HK4ZjMpF-?usp=sharing), or generated from the following commands:

```
./reorder-docids --collection $SPLADE_ORIGINAL_FILE --output $REORDERED_INDEX_PATH --from-mapping $CLUSTER_MAPPING_FILE

./lexicon build $DOC_MAP_FILE $DOC_LEX_FILE

./compress_inverted_index -c $REORDERED_INDEX_PATH -o $COMPRESSED_INDEX_FILE -e block_simdbp

./create_wand_data -c $REORDERED_INDEX_PATH -o $WAND_FILE -b 4000 -s quantized --document-clusters $CLUSTER_INFO_FILE
```

    abstract = "This paper revisits dynamic pruning through rank score thresholding in cluster-based sparse retrieval to skip the index partially at cluster and document levels during inference. It proposes a two-parameter pruning control scheme called ASC with a probabilistic guarantee on rank-safeness competitiveness. ASC uses cluster-level maximum weight segmentation to improve accuracy of rank score bound estimation and threshold-driven pruning, and is targeted for speeding up retrieval applications requiring high relevance competitiveness. The experiments with MS MARCO and BEIR show that ASC improves the accuracy and safeness of pruning for better relevance while delivering a low latency on a single-threaded CPU."
